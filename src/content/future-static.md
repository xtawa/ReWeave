# The Future is Static

Web development has come full circle. We started with static HTML, moved to complex server-side rendering, then to client-side SPAs, and now we are back to static generation (SSG) but with superpowers.

## Why ReWeave?

**ReWeave** is built on the premise that **performance is a feature**.

1.  **Speed**: Pre-rendered HTML means instant time-to-first-byte.
2.  **Simplicity**: No complex hydration or client-side routing unless necessary.
3.  **Beauty**: A design-first approach.
